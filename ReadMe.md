## Description
This is a Java code example of how to read from, edit and write back to a JSON file.

## Requirements
- Java JDK +1_181 (with language level +8)
- IntelliJ IDE
- JSON Library found [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.json-simple/json-simple), or look  in the ```libs``` folder.

## To setup libraries for IntelliJ
1. Create a folder called '*whatever you want*' or (appropriately named ```libs```) in the module root (same folder where your ```src``` folder is in)
2. Copy the library ```json-simple-1.1.1.jar``` into the folder (created above).
3. In IntelliJ, go to that file in the Project Browser (*Shortcut: Alt + 1*)
4. Right-click on the folder, and click on "Mark as Library" option.

You can then use any library/jar file in this folder as a library
